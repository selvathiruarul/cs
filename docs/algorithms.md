# Algorithms

**Algorithm** is well defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output. In other words: "*It'a sequece of computational steps that transform the input into the output.*"

                            Input ---> Finite, ordered list of steps ---> Outputs

## Algorithms Basics

- **Data Structure**
  - is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
  - is a complecity of implementations.
  - is a Stack, Queue, Tree, etc.

- **Analysing Algorithms**
  - memory, communication bandwidth, or computer hardware, computational time.
  - RAM model of implementational technology.
  - arithmetic, data movement, and control - constant time.
  - clgn bits for some constants c >= 1
  - behavior of an algorithm - formulas
