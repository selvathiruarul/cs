# Algorithms

**Algorithm** is well defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output. In other words: "*It'a sequece of computational steps that transform the input into the output.*"

                            Input ---> Finite, ordered list of steps ---> Outputs

- **Data Structure**
  - is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications
  - is a complecity of implementations
  - is a Stack, Queue, Tree, etc
