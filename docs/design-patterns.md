# Design Pattern

In **software engineering**, a [**design pattern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design (solution to a common software problem). A **design pattern** is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code.

## Singelton

In software engineering, the [**singleton pattern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Observer 
The [**observer pattern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

## Factory method
In class-based programming, the [**factory method pattern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) is a creational pattern which uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

## Adapter

In software engineering, the [**adapter pattern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used from another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
