# Algorithms & Data structures

**Algorithm** is well defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output. In other words: "*It'a sequece of computational steps that transform the input into the output.*"

                            Input ---> Finite, ordered list of steps ---> Outputs

## Algorithms Basics

- **Data Structure**
  - is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
  - is a complecity of implementations.
  - is a Stack, Queue, Tree, etc.

- **Analysing Algorithms**
  - memory, communication bandwidth, or computer hardware, computational time.
  - RAM model of implementational technology.
  - arithmetic, data movement, and control - constant time.
  - clgn bits for some constants c >= 1
  - behavior of an algorithm - formulas

## Data Structures

**Data Structures** is a foundations for building algorithms

- **Binomal Heap**
- **B-Tree**
- **List**
  - Operations
    - Search(L, k)
    - Insert(L, x)
    - Delete(L, x)
    - Successor(L, x)
    - Predecessor(L, x)
    - Minimum(L)
    - Maximum(L)
  - Double linked list
  - Searching a linked list
- **Dictionary**
  - Operations
    - `Insert(x,d)` - Insert item x into dictionary d.
    - `Delete(x,d)` - Remove item x (or the item pointed to by x) from dictionary d.
    - `Search(k,d)` - Return an item with key k if one exists in dictionary d.
- **Hash Tables**
- **Maps**
- **Tires**
- **Queue**
- **Stack**
- **Tree**
- **Red Black Tree**
