# MySQL

**MySQL** is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).

## Install

1. Download MySQL. Go to the downloads page at mysql.com. Under the section "MySQL Community Server" click on the "Download" link. Find the particular version of MySQL that is appropriate for your OS and machine architecture. In my case, I downloaded the "Mac OS X 10.5 (x86, 64-bit)" version because I have Mac OS X 10.5 running on a MacBook with a 64-bit Intel processor. You want to download the DMG Archive, not the compressed TAR Archive.
