# Software Architectue

**Software architecture** refers to the fundamental structures of a **software system**, the discipline of creating such structures, and the documentation of these structures. These structures are needed to reason about the **software system**.

A **software architect** is a software expert who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms. The leading expert is referred to as the chief architect.

## Architecture types

- Application 
- Integration
- Enterprice

Each of those architecture share *soft skills*, *continues delivery*, *understanding large codebases*
