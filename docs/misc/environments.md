# Environment Naming Conventions

In **software deployment**, an **environment** or tier is a computer system in which a computer program or software component is deployed and executed.

- Production environment (PROD)
- Test environment (TEST)
- Individual developer environments — refer to as “local” evironments (LOCAL)
- Depending on how much parallel development - might also need a Maintenance environment (MAINT)

*However, many organizations can function effectively with just the DEV-TEST-PROD triad.*
