# Uniform Resource Locator

A [**Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator), commonly informally termed a **web address** (a term which is not defined identically) is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.

## Syntax

Every HTTP URL conforms to the syntax of a generic URI. A generic URI is of the form:

    scheme:[//[user:password@]host[:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment]

## Relative Paths

- `index.html`
- `/graphics/image.png`
- `/help/articles/how-do-i-set-up-a-webpage.html`

## Absolute Paths

The absolute paths **always** include the domain name of the website: `http://wwww.,`

- `http://www.mysite.com`
- `http://www.mysite.com/graphics/image.png`
- `http://www.mysite.com/help/articles/how-do-i-set-up-a-webpage.html`
