In computer **programming**, a [**declaration**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_%28computer_programming%29) specifies properties of an identifier: it declares what a word (identifier) means. **Declarations** are most commonly used for functions, variables, constants, and classes, but can also be used for other entities such as enumerations and type definitions.

In computer science, an [**implementation**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation) is a realization of a technical specification or algorithm as a **program**, software component, or other computer system through computer **programming** and deployment. Many implementations may exist for a given specification or standard.
